# Virtual Bookstore Application

This project is a collaborative effort showcasing our skills in software engineering, problem-solving, and programming. We developed a Virtual Bookstore Application using Java and JavaFX, implementing various software development practices and incorporating essential design patterns such as Singleton, State, Observer, and more.

## Project Overview

### Features

- **User and Admin Login:** The application provides a secure login system for both users and administrators, ensuring controlled access to different functionalities.

- **Book Purchasing Options:** Users can browse through the bookstore, selecting and purchasing books using various payment methods, including cash, points, or a combination of both.

- **Admin Controls:** Administrators have the capability to manage users and books in the system. This includes adding new users, editing user details, adding, editing, or removing books from the inventory.

### Technologies Used

- **Java and JavaFX:** The core of the application is developed using Java, with the user interface designed using JavaFX.

- **Design Patterns:** We incorporated key design patterns such as Singleton to ensure a single instance of critical classes, State for managing user states, and Observer for handling changes and updates.

## How to Run the Application
